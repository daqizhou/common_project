                Kui is a 2 years old cat. All he do is sleep and eat :)
                He is a huge foodie, he loves shrimp the most, he likes to eat grass for his digestion.

                My mom found him on the street near my neiborhood.
                It was a cold windy night, he could have died in that winter night if my mom haven't found him.
